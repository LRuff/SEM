# Introduction

general missing data context

motivation for em

The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm was devloped by @dempster1977maximum to obtain maximum likelihood estimations when the underlying distribution depends on unobserved variables.

# The EM Algorithm

The EM algorithm consists of two steps, namely the *expectation step* and the *maximization step*. Both steps are applied alternately until some convergence criterion is reached. Depending on given data structure, especially the missing data, we can find a *rate of convergence* $DM$ for the parameters. Both aspects of the EM algorithm are explained in this section.

## Objective and algorithm

The model for the complete data is given by

$$
f(Y|\theta),\quad \theta = (\theta_1, ..., \theta_d)
$$

and $Y$ can be separated into a observed $\Yobs$ and a missed part $\Ymis$, such that $Y = (\Yobs, \Ymis)$. We define $\theta^*$ as the maximum likelihood estima (MLE) of the parameter $\theta$. The estimation is based on the observed data $\Yobs$ and therefore maximizes $f(\Yobs|\theta)$. The algorithm starts with an initial parameter value $\theta^{(0)}$, which becomes $\theta^{(t)}$ at the `t`'hs EM iteration, which converges to $\theta^*$.

<!-- explain objective of em, how to obtain Q -->

**Expectation step**. The idea of the so called expectation step (*E step*) is to obtain the expectation value of the log-likelihood function related to the missing data, given the observed data and the parameter at iteration `t`, which is given by

$$
Q(\theta|\theta^{(t)}) = \E_{\Ymis|\Yobs,\theta^{(t)}}[L(\theta|Y)]  = \E_{\Ymis|\Yobs,\theta^{(t)}}[\ln f(Y|\theta)],
$$

while the objective can be calculated by

$$
\E_{\Ymis|Yobs,\theta^{(t)}}[L(\theta|Y)] = \int L(\theta|Y) f(\Ymis|\Yobs,\theta=\theta^{(t)})\,d\Ymis.
$$

**Minimization step**. In the Minimization step (*M step*) the objective of the E step will be maximized, which means that

$$
Q(\theta^{(t+1)}|\theta^{(t)}) \ge Q(\theta|\theta^{(t)}), \quad \forall \theta.
$$

More clearly the parameter $\theta^{(t+1)}$ is obtained by 

$$
\theta^{(t+1)} = \underset{\theta}{\argmax} \,Q(\theta|\theta^{(t)}).
$$

It means that we search for $\theta^{(t+1)}$ which maximizes the objective, given $\theta^{(t)}$ and we can now search for $Q(\theta|\theta^{(t+1)})$ using the E step, which starts the next iteration.

## Rate of convergence

The EM algorithm updates the parameter in every iteration of E step and M step from $\theta^{(t)}$ to $\theta^{(t+1)}$. To describe this behavior we can define a mapping

$$
M: \Theta \to \Theta,\; \theta \mapsto M(\theta)\quad \text{such that}\quad \theta^{(t+1)} = M(\theta^{(t)}),
$$

where $\Theta$ is the parameter space. While $\theta^{(t)}$ converges to $\theta^*$, we can state

$$
\theta^* = M(\theta^*),
$$

where $\theta^*$ is a fixed point of $M$.

To get a rate of convergence, we need a derivation of $M$, which we call $DM$. Therefore we do a taylor approximation of $\theta^{(t+1)}$ in the neighborhood of $\theta^*$ and stop after the linear term, which results in

\begin{align*}
\theta^{(t+1)} &= M(\theta^*) + M'(\theta^*) (\theta^{(t+1)} - \theta^*) + \frac{1}{2} M''(\theta^*)(\theta^{(t+1)} - \theta^*)^2 + ...\\
&\approx \theta^* + M'(\theta^*) (\theta^{(t+1)} - \theta^*).
\end{align*}

Rearraning the equation finally gives

$$
M'(\theta^*) = DM \approx \frac{\theta^{(t+1)} - \theta^*}{\theta^{(t)} - \theta^*},\quad \text{where}\quad DM = \left( \frac{\partial M_j(\theta)}{\partial \theta} \right) \big|_{\theta = \theta^*}.
$$

We call $DM$ the *rate matrix*.

<!-- Short argument, why maximizing Q leads to a better parameter estimation which has a higher *observed-data* (log-)likelihood. Simple proof using Jensen! -->

# The SEM algorithm

In comparison to multiple imputation methods, asymptotic variance-covariance matrices of the parameter estimaton (e.g. standard errors) are not given automatically when using the EM algorithm. Instead, additional steps are required in order to compute standard errors of the estimates. One approach introduced by @meng1991sem is the so-called *supplemented EM* or *SEM* algorithm. This procedure obtains numerically stable asymptotic variance-covariance matrices only from computing the complete-data asymptotic variance-covariance matrix, using code for the E and M steps of EM, and standard matrix operations. The key idea of the SEM algorithm is effectively to numerically differentiate the implicit mapping $\theta \to M(\theta)$ defined by the EM algorithm, i.e. defining a method to compute $DM$.

<!-- ## Notes -->
<!-- It is important to emphasize that the variance-covariance matrix obtained from SEM is based on the second derivatives of the observed-data log-likelihood and only is inferentially valid asymptotically, i.e. for large samples. -->
<!-- The more normal the likelihood, the better the approximation. Therefore, transformations are useful in order to improve the results. (e.g. log(variance), etc.) -->
<!-- Switch notation from $\theta^*$ to $\hat \theta$? This is more consistent with general statistical notation... -->
